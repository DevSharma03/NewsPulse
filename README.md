## Setup & Installation

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DevSharma03/NewsPulse.git
   cd NewsPulse
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   npm start
   ```
4. Open in browser:

   ```

## Usage

- On startup, the app fetches top news headlines (default category).  
- You can switch between categories (if that feature is present / implemented).  
- The layout is responsive: cards will adjust for mobile & desktop.

---

## Configuration

- **API Key**:  
  Currently the NewsAPI key is embedded in the source code. For production or better security, it’s recommended to move the key into environment variables.  

- **Customizations**:  
  You can tweak styling in `index.css`, modify layouts, or adjust categories as needed.

## Future Improvements

Some ideas to extend the project:

- Add a settings panel allowing user to:
  - Change country  
  - Change the API key  
  - Choose light/dark theme  
- Add **skeleton loaders** while data is being fetched  
- Implement **error handling** (e.g. when API fails or rate limited)  
- Add **unit tests** or component tests  
- Improve accessibility
