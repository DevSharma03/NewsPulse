# NewsPulse

NewsPulse is a small React app that shows top headlines by category using the NewsAPI. This repository is a lightweight demo focused on UX and responsive cards.

Quick start:

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the dev server:

```bash
npm start
```

Open http://localhost:3000 to view the app.

Notes:

- The project uses Bootstrap for layout and a custom `index.css` for visual polish.
- The News API key is currently embedded in the code. For production, move it to an environment variable.

Next steps you may want to do:

- Add a small settings panel to change country or API key.
- Add skeleton loaders for cards while fetching.
- Add unit tests for components.
